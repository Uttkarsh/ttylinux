How to use Debian Lenny for compilling ttylinux:

- Install Debian 5.0.7 from the netinstall.iso, choose only the base packages,
  not the desktop packages etc.
- touch /etc/apt/apt.conf
- vi /etc/apt/apt.conf

     APT::Install-Recommends "0";
     APT::Install-Suggests "0";

- apt-get clean all
- apt-get update
- apt-get upgrade
- apt-get install build-essential autoconf automake bzip2 mkisofs bin86 gawk \
          flex bison ncurses-dev docbook-utils

docbook-utils, from my point of view, adds too many additional packages, see
this post for how you can compile ttylinux without docbook2man:

I hope this short how to is useful for you!
Happy ttylinux developing/compiling :-)

best regards,
