The standard BeagleBoard ttylinux uses a standard unpatched kernel from
kernel.org.  Maybe you can get a better OMAP Linux kernel and build BeagleBoard
ttylinux with it.  Look in the site/platform-beagle_xm directory; there is at
least one link and a corresponding kernel configuration file.  Get an OMAP
Linux kernel, possibly from one of the documented links, and change the
ttylinux-config.sh file to use your custom kernel.

The ttylinux-config.sh file has some comments that describe how to use your
own custom kernel; for BeagleBoard ttylinux, change the TTYLINUX_KERNEL setting
to be something like:

TTYLINUX_KERNEL="omap-2.6" # Linux kernel override; empty for normal build.

The links provided in the site/platform-beagle_xm directory may not provide a
good source for an OMAP Linux kernel and you may need to find your own OMAP
BeagleBoard-supporting Linux source tree, and you may also need to make your
own kernel configuration file.
