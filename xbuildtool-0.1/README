You probably want to do this:

For building ttylinux cross-compiler tool chains, type the command "make help",
then run the appropriate make commands, e.g.

     $ make setup
     $ make i486-2.9-gnu


        ----------------------------------------------------------------


Alternatively:

Setup the cross-compiler building environment for xbuildtool:

     $ ./configure

If you want to try to build an arbitrary custom cross-development tool chain,
then cp config/xbt-build-config.sh to the top-level xbuildtool directory:

     $ cp config/xbt-build-config.sh .

Then edit xbt-build-config.sh and make the desired settings.  There are
comments in the file that describe each setting.

     $ vi xbt-build-config.sh

After making the setting in xbt-build-config.sh, run this command:

     $ ./scripts/build-toolchain.sh
